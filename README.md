LiveRes is a client-server system for publishing live results from events. It consists of a PC client pushing data to a server for web publishing.

This version of LiveRes is forked from Peter Löfås's liveresults. An important addition is the interface to eTiming.

The web frontend is published at: htttp://liveres.freidig.idrett.no
